Sprint 1: I created the initial user stories and subtasks for Event Discovery/Management. I also participated in the first project meeting and made sure the requirements were clearly written for later sprints.
Sprint 2: I built the Claim Tickets flow, including both the backend logic for issuing tickets and enforcing capacity, and the frontend UI for claiming tickets. 
Sprint 3: I worked on Admin and Event Analytics. I built the backend analytics calculations and the frontend dashboards, including charts, tiles, and clickable metrics. This sprint involved my biggest PR and required coordinating data between frontend and backend. I fixed a bug where an admin user could log in as organization and vice versa.
Sprint 4: I wrote unit and integration tests for both Admin Dashboard Analytics and Organizer Event Analytics. I validated the metrics, charts, and UI behavior. I also fixed a bug preventing users from creating past events/editing event date to a past date, and solved CI issues related to missing secret variables. I added scrolling feature when clicking on events (couldn't close event description).
